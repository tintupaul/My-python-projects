# My-python-projects
Python script I coded to find the changes in two reports(among which one report will be the updated version of the other).
Report 1 has i number of module names and report 2 has j number of module names. Among this, some module names will be common to both reports.
Corresponding to each module name in both reports, there is a text file in the file server(Z drive).
Program reads all the module files and store the required module details in the MySQL server database(for ease of access in forther data retrieval).
My script compare both reports(via accessing all the module files of each report) and display the changes in the new report.
